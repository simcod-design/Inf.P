# Inf.P cutoff 

This repository contains code used to reproduce simulations and applications in the article  
**"Defining an Optimal Cut-Off for Subscales Without a Gold Standard: A Novel Method Using Inflection Points of Latent Attribute Probabilities and Raw Scores"** by Pervin Demir and Selcen Yuksel.

**Simulation** contains R scripts used to generate simulated data and evaluate the proposed method under various simulation scenarios.

**Example** includes code for performing the cutoff point determination steps based on a sample condition, as illustrated in the manuscript.

**Figures** contains scripts used to generate the figures presented in the article, including inflection curves, accuracy comparisons, and diagnostic performance plots.

**Real app** provides code for applying the proposed method to real-world data derived from clinical or psychological measurement contexts.
