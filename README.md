# Inf.P cutoff 

This repository contains code used to reproduce simulations and applications in the article  
"Defining an Optimal Cut-Off for Subscales Without a Gold Standard: A Novel Method Using Inflection Points of Latent Attribute Probabilities and Raw Scores"** by Pervin Demir and Selcen Yuksel.

**Simulation** contains R scripts used to generate synthetic data and evaluate the proposed method in simulation settings.
**Example** contains the code for performing the cutoff point determination steps based on a sample condition, using the example provided in the manuscript.
**Figures** contains scripts used to generate the figures presented in the article, including inflection curves, accuracy comparisons, and diagnostic performance plots.
**Real app** contains code used to apply the proposed method to real-world data from a clinical or psychological measurement context.
