**“Figure456.R”** contains box plot figures summarizing the bias and mean squared error (MSE) values for Accuracy, Sensitivity, and Specificity.

The data used in these figures are derived from two data sets:
*A123.sav*: This dataset includes the bias and MSE values for estimates obtained at each step.
*means.sav*: This dataset consists of simulation results across 60 distinct conditions, including mean bias estimates with 95% confidence intervals and mean squared errors for Accuracy, Sensitivity, and Specificity. 

**“Figure3supp.ipynb”** contains a graph illustrating the 95% confidence intervals for the median values of the cutoff points. The graphs were generated using the boundary values contained in the "bound.csv" file and the prediction values from the "A123.sav" file.
